2. To generate the build scripts run the following commands. Alternatively will depend on react-scripts.
```
cd my-app
npm run eject
```

## Setting up App for Development
1. Open a command prompt and direct to the my-app directory.
2. Launch Visual Studio Code by running the following command
```

            "url": "http://localhost:3000",
            "webRoot": "${workspaceRoot}/src",
            "runtimeArgs": ["--disable-web-security"]
        }
    ]
}
```

## Launching App for Development
1. Open a command prompt and direct to the my-app directory.
2. To launch the app on http://localhost:3000/ run the npm start command.
```
cd my-app
npm install
npm start
```

## Building App for Production
1. Open a command prompt and direct to the my-app directory.
2. run the npm run build command.
```
npm run build
```
3. app will be output to my-app\build

## Running Production Build
1. Open a command prompt and direct to the my-app directory.
2. Install static server
```
yarn global add serve
```
3. Launch the static server
```
serve -s build
```

## React Development Workflow
 JSX > Babel (react-scripts) > React JavaScript (react) > React Dom (react-dom) > Html

## React Component
1. Props
2. State
3. Render
