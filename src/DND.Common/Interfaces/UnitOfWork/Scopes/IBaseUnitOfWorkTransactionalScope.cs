	/// business transaction (i.e. each service method) that uses Entity Framework must
    /// be wrapped in a UnitOfWorkScope, ensuring that the same DbContext instances 
    /// are used throughout the business transaction and are committed or rolled 
    /// back atomically.
    /// 
    /// Think of it as TransactionScope but for managing DbContext instances instead 
    /// of database transactions. Just like a TransactionScope, a UnitOfWorkScope is 
    /// ambient, can be nested and supports async execution flows.
    /// 
	/// And just like TransactionScope, it does not support parallel execution flows. 
	/// You therefore MUST suppress the ambient UnitOfWorkScope before kicking off parallel 
	/// tasks or you will end up with multiple threads attempting to use the same DbContext
	/// instances (use IUnitOfWorkScopeFactory.SuppressAmbientContext() for this).
    /// 
    /// You can access the DbContext instances that this scopes manages via either:
    /// - its DbContexts property, or
    /// - an IAmbientDbContextLocator
    /// 
    /// (you would typically use the later in the repository / query layer to allow your repository
    /// or query classes to access the ambient DbContext instances without giving them access to the actual
    /// UnitOfWorkScope).
